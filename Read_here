Hey Viewer!
This project is all about coordinates detector. The main motive of this project is to use Google API key  and to find the latitude
and the longitude of an entred address. This project is useful to figure out the accurate coordinates of a particular location entred.
The entire project is developed in python as to understand the working of the code when integrated with Google API keys.
In order to maintain the accuracy of the location, I have used the google API key and the Google Maps API key, which improved the 
accuracy level of finding the latitude & longitude of a particular location.

This project is suitable to work in the domain of Security surveillance systems, defence radar systems and 
other related category of defence systems where coordiantes are to be measured for counter stricks at high terrains of warefare.

To set-up this project, follow the below:
1. Enable Google API's (Google Colud Console -> new project -> Enable Geocoding API)
2. Enable Google Maps API key
3. In order to support Google Coding API, install the python "requests" library.
-> Sysntax:: " pip install requests "
4. use the Source code and replace your generated API KEY in the code mentioned*.
5. Replace the address to find the coordinates in the source code;

*Note : While generating your API keys, do make sure to ceate API credentials for the API to be used.
And your good to go with the project!!
